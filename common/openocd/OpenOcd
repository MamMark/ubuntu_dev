openocd commands that interact with gdb (defaults):

gdb_memory_map enable
gdb_breakpoint_override disable   [hard|soft|disable]
gdb_flash_program enable
gdb_memory_map    enable
gdb_report_data_abort disable
gdb_target_description enable

script search path:

the current directory,
any search dir specified on the command line using the -s option,
any search dir specified using the add_script_search_dir command,
$HOME/.openocd (not on Windows),
a directory in the OPENOCD_SCRIPTS environment variable (if set),
the site wide script library $pkgdatadir/site and
the OpenOCD-supplied script library $pkgdatadir/scripts.

(if no filenames specified, looks for openocd.cfg)


A target needs its TAP added to the scan chain.  ie.

target create MyTarget cortex_m -chain-position mychip.cpu
$MyTarget configure -work-area-phys 0x08000 -work-area-size 8096
$MyTarget configure -event reset-deassert-pre { jtag_rclk 5 }
$MyTarget configure -event reset-init { myboard_reinit }

You should specify a working area if you can; typically it uses some
on-chip SRAM. Such a working area can speed up many things, including
bulk writes to target memory; flash operations like checking to see
if memory needs to be erased; GDB memory checksumming; and more.

Warning: On more complex chips, the work area can become inaccessible
when application code (such as an operating system) enables or disables
the MMU. For example, the particular MMU context used to access the virtual
address will probably matter ... and that context might not have easy
access to other addresses needed. At this writing, OpenOCD doesn’t have
much MMU intelligence.

It’s often very useful to define a reset-init event handler. For systems
that are normally used with a boot loader, common tasks include updating
clocks and initializing memory controllers. That may be needed to let you
write the boot loader into flash, in order to “de-brick” your board; or to
load programs into external DDR memory without having run the boot loader.
