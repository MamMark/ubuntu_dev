Mac OS X Host/Linux Vagrant Guest Install

0) Make sure you have a case sensitive file system, call it Repos.
   This mounts on the Mac OS X side as /Volumes/Repos.

   WARNING: This most likely needs to be a seperate file system from your root
   because case sensitivity on the Mac can mess up stupid mac programs that don't
   handle case sensitive filenames properly.

1) Install required software

   o Vagrant:
     https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.1.2/vagrant_2.1.2_x86_64.dmg

   o Virtualbox:  (currently frozen at 5.1.26)
     https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.26/VirtualBox-5.1.26-117224-OSX.dmg
     https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.26/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.26-117224.vbox-extpack

   o Emacs 25 for MacOSX:
     https://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-25.1-1-universal.dmg

     yes we want to force version 25.

   o Install Xquartz.
     https://www.xquartz.org/  https://dl.bintray.com/xquartz/downloads/XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg

   o Install brew.  See: https://brew.sh/
     /usr/bin/ruby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)”

   o git for mac os x:
     from a terminal window type “git —version”.  If git is available it
     will display git’s version number.  Otherwise a pop up window will
     show up.  Chose “Install” to install “command line developer tools”.
     If desired you can install the full Xcode tools (>6G).

   o Install bash4.   See https://gist.github.com/samnang/1759336
     brew install bash

2) Change your shell:
   sudo bash -c “echo /user/local/bin/bash >> /private/etc/shells”
   chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

   make sure your path includes /usr/local/bin
   logout and log back in.

3) clone ubuntu_dev to obtain the tag-dev Vagrantfile
   cd ~
   mkdir w
   cd w
   git clone -o mm https://github.com/MamMark/ubuntu-dev

4) bring up the test VM, tag-dev.

   cd ~/w/ubuntu_dev/tag-dev
   vagrant up

5) The creation of the tag-dev VM above will create initial versions of the
   local repositories iff the directory /home/<user>/tag (on the host,
   upstairs) doesn’t exists.

   It will create the following:

   tag/mm           MamMark repository
   tag/prod         tp-freeforall fork of the tiny_prod repository
   tag/dot-files    MamMark standard dot files

6) If desired, Install dot-files from tag/dot-files onto host side.

   Only do this if you want the same dot files on the host and guest.

   cd ~/tag/dot-files
   cp -Rv .[bem]* .gdbinit .gitconfig ~/

   the above will install dot files into home for your local user on the
   host.  (upstairs)

   comment out the EXPECTED_USER check in .bashrc
   edit [user]/{name,email} in .gitconfig.  Make them your own.

   log out and back in.

7) Launch local Emacs.  (will use just installed emacs init files)
   o install magit into Emacs25.
     M-x package-refresh-contents RET
     M-x package-install RET magit RET

8) Log into the VM
    vagrant ssh


Other Notes:

o install mm/tools/utils/{tagcore, binfin, tagdump, etc}
