These are notes about various things about the msp430 toolchain.

TI and Redhat have taken over support of the mspgcc varient of the msp430
toolchain.  It gets released as a complete package (see versioning notes
below).

As of 10/29/15 we install from msp430-gcc-full-linux-installer-3.5.0.0.run

Versioning notes:

MSP430-GCC  3_05_00_00
Build date: 09152015

Changes in This Release:
  Updated GCC compiler (14r1-364)
  Code to disable watchdog timer has been removed from start-up sequence (See examples)
  Updated gdb agent (6.0.14.5)
  Added support for following GDB monitor commands:
    'monitor reset' - reset the CPU
    'monitor halt' - halt the CPU

For example: MSP430-GCC  3_05_00_00
msp430-elf-gcc (GCC) 4.9.1 20140707 (prerelease (msp430-14r1-364)) (GNUPro 14r1) (Based on: GCC 4.8 GDB 7.7 Binutils 2.24 Newlib 2.1)

(gnupro [2])

The versioning of our package works as follows:

1. Digit: GCC Version
2. Digit: Debug stack version
3. Digit: Header/linker file version
4. Digit: Build number

Why did we do this?

We're shipping stand-alone packages & "distributions" that include all of the above.
With the version scheme you instantly see if we just updated support files OR the
debug Stack OR the actual compiler. This will hopefully help you to determine where
you want to update or not.


INSTALL_DIR is typically /opt/ti-mspgcc.


debugging via gdb and gdb_agent [1]:

$INSTALL_DIR/bin/gdb_agent_console $INSTALL_DIR/msp430.dat

make debug
<gdb>
load
target remote :55000


EABI for mspgcc 4.9.1 and TI proprietary compiler [3]:
  Calling conventions have changed from previous mspgcc toolchain to allow
  compatibility with the TI proprietary toolchain.
